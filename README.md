# ⏱️ Super Simple Stopwatch

Super Simple Stopwatch is a project that aims to provide a basic stopwatch functionality using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

This project is intended to be a beginner-friendly introduction to the basics of web development.

It was created as a result of Neutron Dev's [⏱️ Build A Super Simple Stopwatch in JavaScript](https://neutrondev.com/build-stopwatch-javascript/) video tutorial.

To use the stopwatch, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. 

Then, click the "Start" button to start the stopwatch, "Pause" to pause the stopwatch, "Resume" to resume the stopwatch, and "Reset" to reset the stopwatch.
